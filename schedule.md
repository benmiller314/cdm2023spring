<h2 id="unit-1">Unit I: What Makes Digital Media New?</h2>
<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-01">Lesson 1, Tuesday 1/10</a> – Introductions</h3>
HW for next time:

* Surveys and sharing:
  - **Complete** two short [modules on Canvas]({{site.canvas_url}}/modules), about self- and community-care and the grading contract. This includes a short "quiz" (should take just a minute or two) and a chance to propose changes or adopt the contract.
  - **Read** the [rest of the syllabus]({{site.github_url}}/uploads).
  - **Respond** to the [Tech Comfort Survey](http://bit.ly/cdm2021survey) if you haven't yet done so.
* Written introduction to the people in the class:
  - **Join** [GitHub](https://github.com/) if you haven't yet (you can use your Pitt email to get [free private repositories](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/student_application)!),
  - **and post** an introduction to yourself on <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}/1">the issue queue</a>.
* Prep software for next class:
  - **Download and install** the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com)
  - If you don't already have one, please **download and install** a plain text editor with syntax highlighting. If you don't have a preference, try Microsoft's **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**, which runs on PC, Mac, and Linux. (Chromebook users might try [Caret](http://thomaswilburn.net/caret/).)
    - Especially if you don't know what "syntax highlighting" is, I recommend this [7-minute intro to VS Code](https://youtu.be/B-s71n0dHUk).


<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-02">Lesson 2, Thursday 1/12</a> – Interfaces and Repositories</h3>

HW for next time:
* **Read / play** through Tyler Su's ["Playing Lev Manovich"](https://tylersu.github.io/o/). Be ready to talk about what you noticed, and what you wondered.
* **Listen** to example audio narratives (see lesson plan for links)
* **Write** a short blog post: what do you notice? what do you wonder? Post this on <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the Issues page</a>.
* EXT for eager readers: interested in more on affordances? Try [this short chapter](https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/books/design/chapter7.pdf) from *Keywords in Design Thinking*.



<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-03">Lesson 3, Tuesday 1/17</a> – Digital Affordances</h3>
<!-- Be sure to clarify that what you want is a single folder and a single file, so you can track its evolution. Some people always seem to want to create new repos for each draft, which defeats the purpose. -->

For next time:

* **Download** the [Audacity 3](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) audio editor if you haven't yet, or update to the latest version if you already have it.
  * *Optionally* also download the [separate FFmpeg import/export library](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/faq_installing_the_ffmpeg_import_export_library.html)
* **Watch** the recommended [Audacity 3 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1WzmigxZdM) and come in ready to play with the software (and ask any questions that come up)
* **Read** the excerpt from *Writer/Designer* on assets and fair use, plus (optionally) a webcomic on Creative Commons. [NB: this was moved up, so it's okay if you don't get to it until the weekend] <!-- REMOVE THIS NOTE NEXT TIME YOU TEACH IT -->
<!-- * **Schedule** a one-on-one conference with Ben using https://benmiller314.youcanbook.me -->


<h2 id="unit-2">Unit II: Soundscapes and Soundwriting</h2>

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-04">Lesson 4, Thursday 1/19</a> – Audacity; Sound On, Sound Off<!-- discuss posts. skip demo. play with audacity. generative writing toward a proposal -->
<!-- Re: playing with Audacity: instead of representative and reprehensible sampling, what if we practice looping and alignment?
--></h3>

For next time:

* **Read and listen** to the audio recording advice (Fowkes and MacAdam) if you haven't yet
* **Write** a proposal for your audio narrative, including a prospective asset list (as per *W/D*); post to <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the Issues page</a>.
<!-- * **Listen to and record** a piece of your local soundscape THIS IS GOOD, BUT I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME IN THE SPRING -->
* **Begin** sourcing the sounds you'll need
* **Bring** headphones so you can work in class
<!-- Ben HW: bring in sounds to practice with -->

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-05">Lesson 5, Tuesday 1/24</a> – Recording, Ethics, Studio<!-- reading comprehension, general proposal advice, but mostly studio so they can turn in a preview on Thurs --></h3>


For next time:

* **Skim** the audio resources on the site, and read more deeply in anything that seems like it would help you.
  - In particular, I recommend the LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda) series of videos on Audacity. It's about 2 hours total, but [I've marked my highlights]({{site.github_url}}/resources#lil-audacity).
* **Push** a soundscape preview, including
  - the layered Audacity file (.aup3)
  - one screenshot of your work in progress (.png)
  - one exported playable sound file (.mp3)
  - a brief description of what you've included (.txt or .md)


<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-06">Lesson 6, Thursday 1/26</a> –  Sound criteria and stretch goals</h3>


For next time:
* **Work** to bring in a full draft of your soundscape narrative
* **Continue** taking screenshots and posting meaningful commits to GH
* **Push** a full draft, with the same four parts as the preview *plus* a SOURCES.md file crediting your sources and permissions/license to use them
* **Bring** headphones

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-07">Lesson 7, Tuesday 1/31</a> – Sound Workshop</h3>

For next time:
* **Keep working** toward your soundscape narrative, incorporating feedback from partners.
* If you haven't finished *giving* feedback, please do so asap, and ideally before Thursday morning.
* Optionally, **write** a blog post of possible integrative projects for the end of term. <!--What games or branching narratives do the soundscapes put you in mind of? Or what do you know you won't have time for now, but maybe could build toward by the end of the term? --> What more might you want to explore?
* **Bring** headphones so you can work in class


<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-08">Lesson 8, Thursday 2/2</a> – Sound Studio</h3>

For next time:

* **By 11:59pm on Sunday,** aim to complete – at least for now – your soundscape narrative.
* **By Tuesday's classtime,** write a prose reflection that incorporates images from your feedback and screenshots of your Audacity project.



<h2 id="unit-3">Unit III: Visual Rhetorics and Argument</h2>

*In this unit, you will make a claim through the juxtaposition of images and text. As with the sound project, the context for your argument is open: you could be making a social commentary, calling for action, constructing a parody, riffing on a pun, explaining a concept, and so on. Whatever you choose, you should consider your audience and what they would find persuasive or interesting, and how you therefore wish to attract and direct their attention.*

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-09">Lesson 9, Tuesday 2/7</a> – Can You Picture It? Visual Rhetorics and Argument</h3> <!-- Introduce unit assignment; start hw reading in class, if possible -->

For next time:

* **Read** a quick introduction to graphic design principles
* **Find** an example of a rhetorical visual design
* **Write** a post on the relevant <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">issue queue</a> about your example, using the analytical language from the reading

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-10">Lesson 10, Thursday 2/9</a> – Generating Visual Ideas</h3> <!-- practice vocab by analyzing examples of past student projects: emphasize emphasis; design vs. intervention; audience addressed, audience invoked. end with Perl-esque guidelines -->

For next time:
* **Skim** the visual media [resources]({{site.github_url}}/resources) on the course site, and read/watch more deeply in anything that seems like it would help you.
* In particular, I highly recommend the LinkedIn Learning series of videos on "GIMP Essential Training." It's about *5* hours of material, which I'm not expecting you to view all of in one weekend (though you do you): as before, [I've marked some highlights and starting points]({{site.github_url}}/resources#lil-gimp). I've been using GIMP for years, and I confess I learned some things even from the basic tool options videos. Note that there are exercise files, should you want to follow along and make sure it works in practice.
  - If you've been having trouble with LinkedIn Learning, try [this LIL link, which routes through MyPitt](https://my.pitt.edu/launch-task/all/cssd-linkedinlearning?terms=linkedin&roles=). I also am happy to troubleshoot with you during office hours!
* **Write** a visual argument proposal, including a prospective asset list and a rough sketch; post to <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the issue queue</a>
* **Bring** headphones for <a href="https://www.noisli.com/">sonic isolation</a>, if you'd like

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-11">Lesson 11, Tuesday 2/14</a> – Generative Studio</h3>
<!-- Open class with guidance re: proposals -->
<!-- NEW AFTER 2023 SPRING: help students choose reasonable canvas sizes by looking into the defaults for new files when you tour the software. -->
For next time:

* **Compose and push** a visual rhetoric preview; workshop-ready draft due in one week.
* (Weekend reading, should you want it / have more time now: **Read** about fonts<!-- https://trydesignlab.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-font-for-your-design/ is part 2, but parts 1 and 3 are less essential. Other links within part 2 are EXT for eager readers. -->, optionally playing a font-matching game<!-- http://www.typeconnection.com/ -->)


<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-12">Lesson 12, Thursday 2/16</a> – Visual Unit Criteria and Stretch Goals</h3> <!-- NB: In 2023, this is CCCC week for some reason. -->

For next time:

* **Read** about fonts<!-- https://trydesignlab.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-font-for-your-design/ is part 2, but parts 1 and 3 are less essential. Other links within part 2 are EXT for eager readers. -->, optionally playing a font-matching game <!-- http://www.typeconnection.com/ -->
* **Compose and push** a workshop-ready visual rhetoric draft


<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-13">Lesson 13, Tuesday 2/21</a> – Visual Unit Workshop</h3>

For next time:

* *Optionally*, **write** a post on the <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">issue queue</a> with more ideas toward the final / integrative project unit. What further possibilities might you want to explore?
* **Bring** headphones for <a href="https://www.noisli.com/">sonic isolation</a>, if you'd like

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-14">Lesson 14, Thursday 2/23</a> – Revision Studio</h3>

For next time:

* **By 11:59pm on Sunday,** complete – at least for now – your visual argument
* By classtime on Tuesday, post a prose reflection to <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the issue queue</a> that incorporates images from your feedback and screenshots of your GIMP project.
<!-- BEN HW: Choose sample student website projects to assign. Focus on work by people without prior experience – including Lynn Priestley's tea shop -->

<h2 id="unit-4">Unit IV: Webslinging (HTML + CSS markup)</h2>

*In this unit, you will build a multi-page website from scratch, beginning with html and css files.*

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-15">Lesson 15, Tuesday 2/28</a> – Midterm Reflections and Generative Writing </h3> <!-- Generative loop writing: what are the collections & categories of things you've made? Things you'd want to make? Offline sketching NOTES FOR SPRING 2023: encourage mobile-first sketching! -->

For next time:

* Review sample student website projects
* Consider the collections of work you might want to gather
* **Write** a website proposal, including at least one hand-drawn design sketch, types of pages, a prospective asset list, and a link to your repo. Post to the <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">issue queue</a>.

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-16">Lesson 16, Thursday 3/2</a> – Intro to Markup and Web Design</h3>
<!--
BEN HW:
  * Record and post screencast on <nav><ul><li><a>, removing bullets, and resizing with padding. Then update the HW for after break to include this.
  * Record and post a screencast of building a CSS layout from an offline sketch
-->

For next time:

<!-- NEW AFTER 2023spring: Add semantic HTML tutorial now instead of later! -->

* *Optional* If you haven't yet, spend some time getting to know your plain-text editor.
  - Can it show two or more files side by side? Can it preview how an html file will render? Does it allow plugins or extensions to enable either of those things?
  - If you're using VSCode, you may want to check out some [intro tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6YeMhvp2S5UgiQnBfvD7XgOMKs3O_G6). I also recommend this list of [HTML-specific features and optional settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html).
* **Do** as much of the [Interneting is Hard (but it doesn't have to be)](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/) tutorial as you have time for – but **at least parts 1-4** (from "Introduction" through "Hello, CSS"). <!-- NEW AFTER 2023spring: Then skip ahead to Semantic HTML. -->
  * Heads up to fast workers: Float layouts used to be a big deal, but aren't as widely recommended any more. *You can probably skip the Float chapter*, at least for now.
* **Show your work** by pushing your tutorial code to your project repository.
  * Do start by copying the pages as written, before attempting to adapt to your own work: confirm that you can get them to look the same as in the tutorial.
  * If your pages *aren't* working the same as in the tutorial, please do check with me! I'll set aside some breakout group time when we get back, but feel free to email or use the [issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}) in the meantime: see if your question's been answered, and if not, [post a new issue]({{site.github.issues_url}}/new/choose), because you're probably not alone.

<!-- * *Optionally* bring headphones for sonic isolation during studio time -->

<div class="alert alert-danger">
Spring break! No classes on 3/7 or 3/9.

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-17">Lesson 17, Tuesday 3/14</a> – Studio / Stylesheeting </h3>

<!--

EXT: Self-paced tutorialing, using the lessons to build prelim pages of your own. That is, once you have the tutorial working, try swapping in your own content for the tutorial's: an about page, an image or two, a linked credits page. And if not today, then Thursday

NEW AFTER 2020fall: Troubleshoot with Ben in a breakout room if your content doesn't work like the tutorial's.

NEW AFTER 2023spring: Suggest the Web Typography lesson as an EXT, and then as a priority for in-class work on Tuesday.

-->

* **Do** more of the [HTML and CSS tutorial](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/), including at least The Box Model (5) and CSS Selectors (6), if you haven't yet. 
* **Read** more about [how CSS selectors work](https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/) *OR* if you prefer game-based learning to straight-up reading, try loading and clearing plates at the [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/). (There's still reading, in the sidebar, which tells you how to win the round.)
<!-- * **View** screencast on using <nav><ul><li></a> and CSS to remove bullets ... and to resize the <a> directly using padding. Point out that this is a direct application of the Box Model. -->


<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>NB: This Friday, March 17th, is the Spring Term deadline for students to submit <a href="https://www.asundergrad.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/Monitored%20Withdrawal%20Request.pdf">Monitored Withdrawal</a> forms to Dean’s Office. If you find yourself missing a lot of work in one of your classes, such that a full course do-over might help you, talk to your advisor and/or professor about this option.</p>
</div>

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-18">Lesson 18, Thursday 3/16</a> – Studio / Navigation</h3>

<!-- Make sure everyone knows how to make a navigation menu using <nav><ul><li><a>. -->

For next time:

<!-- NEW AFTER 2023spring: DON'T DO the tutorial for Flexbox. It's overly cluttered HTML, it doesn't have Grid anyway, and there are better resources out there. Which resources, exactly? I'll have to look... -->

* **View** video on [5 simple tips to making responsive layouts the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQraviuwbzU&list=PL4-IK0AVhVjM6kuUoUexfmnD8vHtZkXdd&index=4) 
* **Do** more of the [tutorial](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/), including at least Flexbox (8) and Responsive Design (10), if you haven't yet. 
  - As a reminder, you should **write out the exercises in the tutorials** and push them to your repository – probably in the tutorials subfolder. Once you have them working as presented, feel free to update them to test out ideas for your own site! But do try to confirm you can get them working first. HTML, like all code, is fiddly: punctuation (including spaces) matters for things like close-tags and CSS selectors.
* Separately, also **read** about [Grid Layout](https://medium.com/deemaze-software/css-grid-layout-crossed-sections-fca9e956e725) (and optionally the followup post on [responsive grid](https://medium.com/deemaze-software/css-grid-responsive-layouts-and-components-eee1badd5a2f)).
  - EXT: Want more CSS Grid templates and examples, including CodePens to play with? Try [Grid By Example](https://gridbyexample.com/patterns/), which also has video tutorials.
* **Compose and push** a first website preview: a beginning, focused on content and navigation.


<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-19">Lesson 19, Tuesday 3/21</a> – Web Unit Studio / Layout Q & A</h3>

<!--
* Make sure everyone has successfully activated GitHub Pages before they leave.
  - Note that the landing page has to be called index.html. You can always change the <title>.
  - Note that the instructions at  https://pages.github.com/ are confusing, because we *don't want to create a whole new repo.*

* Self-paced tutorial-ing / applications of tutorial to your own content
* Troubleshoot with Ben in a breakout room if your content doesn't work like the tutorial's.
-->

For next time:
* **Continue** the [HTML &amp; CSS tutorial](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/), adding at least Semantic HTML (12) and Web Typography (14). If you're encountering weird layout intransigence, you may also want to try Advanced Positioning (9).
  - Remember that the main tools for layout now in use are Grid and Flex; you can probably skip the chapter on Float except for particular use-cases (e.g. text that wraps around an image).
  - **Email me with any questions**, noting that I can help fastest if you include screenshots and links to your site/repo. Better yet, [create a New Issue]({{site.github.issues_url}}/new/choose)! Then my answer to you can help others, too.
* **Compose and push** a second website preview, now adding or updating layout. A full, workshop-ready draft of your website project is due in one week.

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-20">Lesson 20, Thursday 3/23</a> – Web Unit Criteria and Stretch Goals / Studio</h3>

<!--
* Model building a design from a hand-drawn sketch.
* Self-paced tutorial-ing / applications of tutorial to your own content, in breakouts
* Q&A with Ben, especially if your tutorials aren't working as expected.
* Remind people that local file paths aren't going to work! Show them the browser extension for replacing images with their alt text / detecting accessibility problems.
-->
For next time:

* **Compose and push** a full draft of your website project by Tuesday morning, let's say 11:59am.
  * If you're doing something advanced (Jekyll, React, etc) that will require a server and not just a browser, be sure to **explain in your repo's README.md file how to load your files**.
  * If you haven't already done so in class, test that your website portfolio is ready for your workshop partners to download: **try to clone it again to a new location** on your computer: if you can successfully open your pages in a local browser from that second location, you should be good to get feedback even from an asynchronous workshop.
    - (You should then also <em>delete that extra copy</em>, before you get confused as to where you're revising and pushing from.)

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-21">Lesson 21, Tuesday 3/28</a> – Web Unit Workshop </h3> 
For next time:

* Optionally, **write** one more blog post about what you'd like to do in our final / integrative unit. If you're interested in finding people to collaborate with, this is a good time to make a pitch.
  - Post this to <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the issue queue</a>, as usual
* Continue to **save, commit, and push** toward your final-for-now website.
* If you didn't get feedback, please **let me know** asap!

<!-- <div class="alert alert-danger">
<span style="color: #c51100;">Heads up: This will be a <strong>fully asynchronous</strong> workshop. See lesson plan for details, but please try to leave your feedback <em>by Thursday morning if possible</em>, so your classmates have the studio time to revise with your input in mind.

Planning ahead:

* The website project and prose reflection will be due **by next Friday (4/7),** incorporating (as usual) images from your feedback and screenshots of your work in progress. If you'll need an extension, please confirm it by Tuesday (4/4).

<div class="alert alert-warning"><span style="color: #c51100;">NB: Ben will be traveling next week because of Passover. Tuesday's class and office hours (April 4) will be <em>fully remote</em>; Thursday's class and office hours (April 6) are <em>canceled</em>.</span></div>

*In this final unit I'll ask you to build on what you've already made: a revision, an extension, or a combination, of the modes and media you used in earlier units. If you have a team that can collaborate effectively, that's up to you! Please do let me know if you want to be in a break-out group together during any remaining online classes. It's a short sprint to the end of term, so scope your ambitions accordingly!*

<!-- <p>If you're feeling especially aspirational, might I suggest that a game or interactive story built in <a href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a> might serve that combinatory goal quite well? I'll see what I'm able to screen-record by way of introduction / guidance.</p> -->



<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-24">Lesson 24, Tuesday 4/11</a> – Intro to Consolidation / Integration Unit: Charting a Course Forward</h3>

For next time:
* *Preparing for the final portfolio:*
  * **Read** Paul Ford's short "Letter of Recommendation: Bug Fixes" from <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-bug-fixes-git.html">The New York Times Magazine</a></em> (June 11, 2019). ([Pitt Library link](http://pitt.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.pitt.idm.oclc.org/docview/2237787684))
  * Ford writes, "I read the change logs, and I think: <em>Humans can do things.</em>" **Read back** through your own change logs, i.e. the commit histories of your projects; skim through the lesson plans; maybe even review your studio goals and exit notes. What things have you done this semester?
* *Preparing one final project or revision:*
  * Work through the questions in the EXT, if you didn't yet, to develop an informal project pitch you can post to the shared google doc.
  

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-25">Lesson 25, Thursday 4/13</a> – Consolidation Unit Pitch Market and Studio</h3>

For next time:
* Set yourself some deadlines: what are you trying to finish by the last class (in one week!)? Will you continue beyond that, knowing the final portfolio is due soon?
* **Push** a project preview (i.e. get something started) to your repository.
* **Document your progress** as you go! Screenshot, save, commit (or otherwise log changes), push, repeat.
* Continue updating and following your work plan.


<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-26">Lesson 26, Tuesday 4/18</a> – Consolidation Unit Studio / Preparing the Final Reflective Letter </h3>

* Continue updating and following your work plan.
* **Push** a project update (i.e. maybe not a finished draft, but closer) to your repository.
* **Document your progress** as you go! Screenshot, save, commit (or otherwise log changes), push, repeat.
* _Optional_: **choose** something from the course that you want to remember beyond this semester: a thing you or someone else made, or said, that struck a chord with you. We'll share these in the last class.

<!-- <p class="footnote"><a href="#ftnref2" id="ftn2">[2]</a> If you're updating an existing project, I recommend doing this in a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-branches">new branch</a> of the old repository, instead. <a href="#ftnref2"><em>~jump back~</em></a></p> -->
