## Office Hours
Drop-ins are welcome during my regular hours, {{site.course.instructor.office_hours}}, or you can book an appointment using the form below. Meetings will be simultaneously <strong>on Zoom, at <a href="https://pitt.zoom.us/my/benmiller314">pitt.zoom.us/my/benmiller314</a></strong>, and (when classes are meeting in person) in <strong>CL 617-N</strong>: through the glass doors near the elevators, then the right-side hallway and way back. And if none of these times work for you, email me (millerb@pitt) to see if we can arrange something else.

Below the signup calendar, I'm also embedding my busy/free status for office hours: <em>if it looks like I have no appointments left open, you can check here:</em> actual reserved appointment slots will show up as "busy" during the standard office-hour window.

In addition, the Digital Media Lab will host limited open hours in CL 435, when student lab assistants will be available to help with projects or loan equipment. In {{site.course.term}}, these have {{site.course.dml_hours}}.
