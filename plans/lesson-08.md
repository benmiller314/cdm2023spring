# Sound studio

**Work to have done**:

* Any remaining feedback from last class's workshop
* Work in pursuit of a final audio narrative
* Optionally, a short [blog post about possible futue audio projects]({{site.github.issues_url}})

**Plan for the day**:

1. It's a studio day! You can choose what to do!
2. But I do have some revision-oriented notes for the whole class
3. Studio time
  - Make a plan
  - Execute it
  - Exit note
4. Deadline reminders

## 1. It's a studio day
<div class="alert alert-success">
<strong>Today is all about working on your individual projects!</strong> Mix sounds, apply effects, watch relevant tutorials. I know your lives are busy; take advantage of this dedicated time free from other distractions and obligations to move your piece forward.
</div>

At the same time, it's worth noting that you're working **in a shared space**, in a studio. If you have questions, or you want feedback on something, you have your classmates and your instructor on-hand. Try not to monopolize anyone's time, but do be open to the possibility of getting farther together than you could on your own.


## 2. Some revision-oriented notes for the whole class
A few seeds of ideas I want to plant, having listened through as much as I could:

<!-- NEW IN 2020:
* endings
* noise reduction
* consider voiceover – or re-recording muffled voices currently in background tracks
-->


<details><summary><em>For full credit in giving credit, wear a TASL.</em></summary>
<p>Some folks have been asking about this, so I want to make sure I talk about it publicly: if you're using sounds someone else recorded, you do have to include enough information to recover where it came from. What information? Well, see <em>Writer/Designer</em> page 162 for the general case, but the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution">Creative Commons' own recommendations</a> specifically recommends you remember the acronym <strong>TASL: Title, Author, Source, License</strong>. (If you know a date, I'd add that, too, for TASLD.) That linked CC page also includes a number of examples; let's look at one or two together!</p>
<p>Of particular note: if you're using source material with a Creative Commons license, <strong>you do need to specify <em>which</em> license it uses</strong>: CC-BY, CC-BY-NC, etc. This is especially important for Share-Alike licenses (CC-BY-SA, etc), because they force you to use the same license and can therefore be in conflict with each other. You can add this information at the end of the audio file, like in Coffee Cart Conversations, or you can use that space after your narrative ends to point listeners toward a text file in your repository.</p>
<p>Note as well that for "Source," a link to the search engine or database that you found it with (e.g. FreeSound) <em>isn't enough</em>: you'll want to point to the specific page for the individual file you're using.</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary><em>Realism doesn't have to mean real time.</em></summary>
<p>Silence, and sameness, sound a lot longer in playback than they do when you're recording them. Two seconds of nothing could be considered a Grand Pause. Think about how you would write a story with words: you wouldn't include every moment, every breath, every footstep; you'd just say, "The doorbell rang, and she opened the door." Similarly, in movies or TV, frequent cuts from one shot to another are the rule, and long takes are the exception. Feel free to elide some moments in time!</p>
<p>In retrospect, the examples I gave you included more examples of continuous time unfolding than of sharp jumps. But if you're trying to cover a larger period than four minutes, it may well help to have discrete / abrupt changes of background noise, music, etc, to signal scene changes. (You can sometimes also time these background changes to align with foreground sounds, like doors closing, a coat zipping, etc.)</p>
<p>And if you're worried about signaling how long something takes <em>within</em> a single scene, consider splitting a background track into two clips, sliding one underneath the other, and crossfading from an earlier to a later point in the same track. It works for dialogue as well as music!</p>
</details>

<!-- <details><summary><em>Differentiate using volume and left/right pan... but don't overdo it.</em></summary>
    <p>Many of you are doing smart work to differentiate foreground sounds from background, in part through "ducking" the background to a lower volume while keeping the sound going to provide depth. Similarly, many of you are doing smart work using left/right channels to differentiate speakers or to move things around the landscape.</p>
    <p>If you haven't yet tried either, go for it! The left/right channels are visible at the left of any track, as long as the track's tall enough. You can adjust the track's overall volume with the gain slider also located there. Alternately, you can use the Envelope Tool to reversibly change volume for just part of the track.</p>
    <p>Two caveats: First, if you're listening to someone way off to your left, you'll probably turn to face them, at least part of the way. So <em>you probably don't need to go all the way to 100% left or 100% right</em> when positioning human voices: try 50% and fine-tune from there.</p>
    <p>Second, one risk of layering sounds is "clipping," the kind of crackle or squeal you get if the sound level exceeds what the system can handle. This can especially happen as you layer these sounds together, or amplify them to bring them closer to the listener. If you notice any one waveform hitting the top of the track, or the overall volume going into the red during playback, you're "clipping" part of your sound. Try Effects > Clip Fix, which should give you a little more room.</p>
</details> -->

<!-- <details><summary><em>Aim to blend at most entrances and exits.</em></summary>

<p>Sometimes, you really do want a sound to enter suddenly: a jump-scare, a bolt of lightning, a phone ringing. But more often, you want the new sound to feel like it's part of the same scene. Sounds recorded in different places often have different levels of background hum, which can make their entrances and exits feel more intrusive. You can mask this with fade-ins/outs, or try to <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/audacity-quick-tip-quickly-remove-background-noise/">remove the background</a>. (That last is easiest if you recorded an extra second or two of "silence" before each take.)</p>

<p>If you want to use music or another kind of background sound to cover transitions, try overlapping the fade-in with the existing scene so as to minimize dead air: at a low volume, the effect will be a more seamless / integrated transition.
</p>
</details> 
-->

<details><summary><em>Consider a musical soundtrack.</em></summary>
<p>Even if your narrative takes place somewhere you wouldn't expect music to actually be audible, a low-key background soundtrack offers a lot of benefits: it covers transitions that would otherwise be silent; it masks differences in background noise across assets and thus helps them seem more like they belong together; and, as we noted when we started this unit, music is great a signaling (or shifting) emotional tone. </p>
<p>Be sure to check out the <a href="../resources#sounds-and-music">Sounds and Music section</a> of the Resources page for tips on where to find openly licensed tracks you can use.</p>
</details>

<details><summary><em>Consider adding a voiceover layer.</em></summary>
<p>Maybe I'm just getting old, but as I've puttered around various places by myself I've noticed that I don't stay silent: I mutter as I putter. Even if it's just short reactions to things I see ("nice!") or read ("really? <em>really</em>."), even if it's not actual words ("hmm."), I tend to narrate my day.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, if your audio narrative takes your listeners along on a ride inside someone's head, but you haven't yet included any human voices, I'd at least give some thought to whether a word here or there might help. (Note that the voice doesn't have to exist in the same timestream as the events of the narrative: think about some of the retrospective commentary in <a href="https://training.npr.org/2015/10/30/six-npr-stories-that-breathe-life-into-neighborhood-scenes/">the NPR reading I had you do</a>, especially the pieces featuring Steve Inskeep and Robert Siegel.) Your narrative, that is, could also have a narrator.</p>
<p>And if you like that idea, but don't want to deal with hearing your own voice recorded, consider swapping scripts with someone else in the class!</p>
</details>


<!-- <details><summary><em>Consider adding a transcript.</em></summary>

<p>If you're working off of a script, as a number of you seem to be, please do consider turning it into a readable transcript you can place alongside the sound file: it's not only more accessible for the temporarily or permanently hearing-impaired, but it also makes your piece easier to search for (and within).</p>

<p>I forgot to send an email with examples (I blame this illness), but I can fix that now! NPR's <em>This American Life</em> does a great job, and they're relatively straightforward in format, too. Why not check out some of their <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/recommended">recommended episodes</a>, including a primer for listeners <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/recommended/new-to-this-american-life">new to the show</a> that tipped me off to this <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/109/notes-on-camp">one on camp</a>. (I was excited by this description: <em>"This one drops you in a place and immerses you there so quickly and happily. Just a deeply cheerful trip into childhood summertime."</em>) Or, for something closer to the length of what you'll be working on – a special episode with <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/241/20-acts-in-60-minutes">20 acts in 60 minutes</a>?</p>

<p>You access the transcript from the top of each full episode page, but you can jump to specific sections, or "acts," when choosing what to listen to.</p>
</details> -->

<details><summary><em>Consider how you'll signal it's over.</em></summary>
<p>Endings are tricky. In an essay, I'd say they usually depend on beginnings: completing some thought you'd left open, or answering a question. In stories, there's often an epiphany (new insight) or a denouement, a return to a previous situation but with the characters' perspectives on it now changed. You can try those things with audio, too, but there are added elements: if you have music, you can make sure to "resolve" back into the root chord, or to complete a rhythmic sequence; if you have an ongoing event, you can fade out; if you have a surprise or joke ending, you can signal intentionality by muting almost all the backgrounds to draw attention to the one track that remains.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to do this. But if you're satisfied with the overall shape, endings are one place where you can put a little extra polish in!</p>
</details>

<details><summary><em>Consider adding a title.</em></summary>
<p>A title can provide a location, a clue, a genre, a commentary; it can make or unmake listener expectations. What will you call your audio narrative? Where will you let listeners know that name? (In the README? In a recorded introduction to the sound file itself, like on a podcast – either with or without a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser?from=Main.ColdOpen">cold open</a>?)</p>
</details>


<!-- <details>
<summary><em>Consider volume.</em></summary>

Many of you are doing smart work to differentiate foreground sounds from background, in part through "ducking" the background to a lower volume while keeping the sound going to provide depth. On the foreground side, one risk of recording original sounds is overloading the microphone, such that you get a kind of crackle or squeal as the sound level exceeds what the system can handle. If you notice this happening – you can look for places where the waveform hits the top of the track, or where the volume goes into the red – try Effects > Clip Fix, which should give you a little more room.

## Homework for next time

* Aiming for 11:59pm on Sunday, but definitely by Tuesday, **complete – at least for now – your audio narrative.** Your repository (on GitHub, ideally, or in a Box/OneDrive folder shared to me) should include:
   - Your most up-to-date layered Audacity project file (.aup3)
   - A flattened, playable export (.mp3)
   - A series, now, of screenshots showing your Audacity project in progress. (Think about what moments are worth remembering as you go: where did you level up, or realize something, or get stuck?)
   - An updated set of credits (in their own file, or in the README) reflecting what you actually used, including documentation of any outside sources and your permission to use them (e.g. explicit licenses like CC – say which one – or fair use)
   - An updated README.md file introducing your soundscape narrative to a new audience. Give your piece a title! Make it something to live beyond this assignment, if you can. :¬)
* By Tuesday's class, **write a prose reflection** that incorporates images from your feedback and screenshots of your Audacity project. As explained in the [prompt](https://github.com/benmiller314/audio-narrative-2023spring#deadlines-and-products), this should include:
   - At least 500 words
   - Your own assessment of how you met the baseline criteria and goals for the unit, as well as any aspirational criteria as appropriate
   - At least one screenshot of feedback you used (and please say how)
   - At least one or two screenshots of your work in progress (ideally, related to the discussion in the previous two bullets)
* **Post your reflection** to the course site's [Issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}), to make it easier to embed images.
   - If you want to then copy the source code into a file in your repo called reflections.md, I won't stop you!
   - If you feel strongly that you'd rather keep your reflection private, you can email it to me instead. But my default assumption is that we learn from each other as much as from ourselves, so I hope you can find a way to write publicly about your experience with this project.
* Relatedly: Want to see a sample reflection? You could do worse than to look at [Fatema Quaid's](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2019fall/issues/3#issuecomment-534351121) notes on "A Haunted Halt" or [Tyller Barner's](https://github.com/pitt-cdm/miller2019spring/issues/2#issuecomment-460512213) on "Coffee Cart Conversations." (I would point out, though, that Barner's is more than three times the minimum length. That's not necessary, or expected! But you can treat that as a maximal vision of what you *might* include.)
