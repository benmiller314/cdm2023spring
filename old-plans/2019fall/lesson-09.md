# Can You Picture It? Visual Rhetorics and Argument

**Work to have achieved**:

* A final-for-now version of your soundscape narratives
* Write and [post]({{site.github.issues_url}}/3) reflection on same


**Plan for the day**:

1. Sound and Image
2. Brief, brief intro to GIMP
3. Visual unit overview and assignment
4. Examples
5. EXT: Start HW
<!-- Have GIMP running in the BG -->

## 1. Sound and Image

First, congratulations on finishing your first project for the class! Take a deep breath!

Second, I know you just finished writing up a reflection on what you did, but I'm going to ask you to write a little more.

* Put aside the details of your project for a moment, and think about what you've learned about **_sound as a composing medium_. What does it make possible? What does it make easy? What does it make difficult?** Take a minute to gather your thoughts on the page.

* Now think about Audacity, in particular, as a tool for soundwriting. Given the possibilities and affordances of sound, how does Audacity (try to) make hard things easier? How does the software tell you what's possible? And what tricks to navigating the software, if any, did you realize only after using it for a while?
<!-- discuss the visual layout of Audacity, e.g. the layers; the feedback of cursor events and changing size/position; the menus -->

For the next unit, you'll be working on directing attention through visual means, and the software I'm asking you to use is [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/): the <span title="It stands for 'GNU's Not Unix.' Yyup.">GNU</span> Image Manipulation Program.

## 2. Brief, brief intro to GIMP
I want to do just a quick preview today, while we're thinking about the shape of tools – and then we'll focus on what I'm asking you to do with them.

Here's a project from last semester's <a href="http://dmap.pitt.edu/digital-showcase-spring-2019">Digital Media Showcase</a>:

Onscreen, it's a flat image. But if we open it in GIMP...

<div class="alert alert-info">
There are lots of tutorials out there, including right on the GIMP website. If you ever get stuck, try <a href="https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-getting-unstuck.html">Chapter 4: Getting Unstuck</a>. (I've also put some other resources on the <a href="{{site.course.base_path}}resources">resources page</a>, and please feel free to suggest others as you find them!
</div>

## Visual unit overview and assignment

Your second project is to **make a rhetorical claim through the juxtaposition of images and text.** It's kind of a collage, but a collage with an argument to make. In assigning this, I have two main goals for you:

1. to learn how to capture images and arrange them using digital tools, and
2. to explore the affordances of still images as a medium, and especially their ability to _direct attention_ and _help make ideas memorable_.

Let's read through this together.

<!-- Go through overview, constraints, deadlines. -->

## 4. Examples

I've started pinning some examples of the kinds of collages and collisions I have in mind, but don't take this as expressing some absolute sense of range:

### EXT: Google Image's Advanced Search Tools
<!--
Not everything is just available for any use – even if you can find it on a public website. See my FAQ from last year at https://cdm2017.majoringinmeta.net/lesson-04/#key-questions-and-considerations-20-30-min.

## EXT: More on GIMP
I'll demo, using Beverly & Pack. "Fly Me to the Moon, by Way of a Hot Air Balloon."" 7 Sept. 2009. Flickr, https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkadog/3897126692/.

Points to hit:
* Single window mode
* Lots of selection tools
   - Quick Mask to help see what's currently selected
* Pay attention to the tiny text at the bottom
<!--* Extracting objects from background. Inverse select-->
<!--
* Layers! Of course layers
* Clone tool; tool settings window
* Scale effects. Rasters vs. vectors
-->



# Homework for next time:

* **Download and install** [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/), the Gnu Image Manipulation Program
* **Read** the following short lessons on graphic design, by independent designer Julie Thompson:
   - <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-positive-and-negative-space">positive and negative space</a>;
   - <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-dominancehierarchy">dominance and hierarchy</a>;
   - <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-rhythm-and-movement">rhythm and movement</a>.
* **Find and photograph** at least one example of a visual or graphic design out in "the wild" that makes some sort of claim, or argument.
   - By "in the wild," I mean that I expect you to come across some in the course of your daily routine. That said, if you need to search more actively, so be it.
   - By "design," I mean that some person made an active choice in its arrangement.
   - By "argument," I mean there should be an idea beyond the pure visual layout. The argument could be explicit or implicit; it could be serious or a joke. (Some claims are just _X is like Y_.) But you should be able to put it in words.
* **Write** a short blog post, sharing your visual argument example. Examine it through the lenses of positive/negative, dominance/hierarchy, and rhythm/movement: what does that help you see? Would you say this is effectively designed for making its argument? (NB: If the argument is implicit, please try to articulate what you think it's claiming.)
   - Post this to the issue queue, under ["Visual Arguments are Everywhere"]({{site.github.issues_url}}/7).
